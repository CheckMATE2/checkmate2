     *  CheckMATE includes convenient means to count events with certain properties. One usually
     *  distinguishes between _signal regions_, which collect events with properties that characterise potential
     *  new physics, _cutflow regions_, which keep track of the individual conditions that lead to 
     *  signal regions to check the correctness of the individual steps, and _control regions_, which 
     *  in rare cases are used to check regions orthogonal to the signal regions for undesired contamination
     *  with signal events. Note that control regions should better be checked in the separate CR.cc analysis 
     *  file that is created if you answered the "Will you implement Control Regions?" question within the 
     *  AnalysisManger with 'yes'. Combining control regions and signal regions within one program is possible,
     *  but usually leads to hard to read code that can easily introduce bugs. 
     * 
     *  CheckMATE first needs to know which regions exist using the bookSignalRegions(), bookCutflowRegions()
     *  and bookControlRegions() functions. Then, a call of countCutflowEvent(), countSignalEvent() or countControlEvent()
     *   at the appropriate step within the analyze() function lets the program internally keep track of the 
     *  event weight that should be counted and - at the end of the run - lists all important information in
     *  cutflow.dat, signal.dat and/or control.dat output files within the CheckMATE results folder.
     * 
     *  **Note** Trying to run countXY on a region that has not been booked will cause the program to automatically
     *  book it as soon as a single event triggers the countXY function. *However* If no event passes the
