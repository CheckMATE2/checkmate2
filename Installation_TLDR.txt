This is a brief note on how to install CheckMATE from the master branch on https://github.com/CheckMATE2/checkmate2

0) The current version is compatible with both Python2 (2.7.4 or later) and Python3 (possibly >= 3.4). 'future' library is required ('pip install future'). You can control which Python version is used at configuring with '--with-python=/path/to/python'. Other than that your default 'python' will be used. Note that the features like multi-bin signal region and likelihoods require Python3. 

1) Requirements
  a) root; anything later than version 6.20 should work just fine; the precompiled root can be obtained from:
     https://root.cern/install/
  b) Delphes 3.5 or later
     https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/delphes/wiki/Releases
     (Should you need version 3.4 you need several changes in the code which you will figure out from compiler errors)
  c) HEPMC2
     https://gitlab.cern.ch:8443/hepmc/HepMC/-/tags
  
  optional:
  d) Pythia; we currently only support 8.2 series
  e) MadGraph5_aMC@NLO; versions >=2.7 should work just fine; 
     with 3-series there are some hiccups but you should get the result anyway; follow the messages on screen 
  f) ONNX Runtime; see: https://onnxruntime.ai/; tested with versions 1.12.1 and 1.13.1 (linux-x64)
  g) Spey, pyhf and spey-pyhf plugin for multibin fits; see https://speysidehep.github.io/spey/quick_start.html#; jax or pytorch or tensorflow are recommended;
     pip install spey
     
     
2) Installation
  a) autoreconf
  b) sample configuration call:
     ./configure --with-delphes=/path/to/delphes --with-hepmc=/path/to/hepmc --with-madgraph=/path/to/madgraph --with-pythia=/path/to/pythia --with-onnx=/path/to/onnxruntime --with-python=/path/to/python
     (optional e.g. -j4 if you would like to compile on 4 cores)
  d) to test the installation (if you linked Pythia):
     cd bin
     ./CheckMATE 13tev_test.in
     or
     ./CheckMATE 13tev_testfull.in
     or
     ./CheckMATE 13tev_testfull2.in

3) New features:
  a) Multibin fits available in atlas_2010_14293, atlas_1908_03122, atlas_1911_12606, atlas_2101_01629, atlas_1908_08215, atlas_2004_14060, atlas_1911_06660, atlas_2106_01676, cms_1908_04722, cms_1909_03460, cms_2107_13021, cms_2205_09597:
     For command line use "-mb select/scan/detailed"; in the input file "Multibin: select/scan/detailed"; for chosing the calculation method: "-mod simple/full"; -exp, -mbcls, -uplim  
     scan: just observed CLs for fast evalutaion;  
     detailed: observed, expected, CLs and upperlimits;  
     simple: calculates CLs and upper limits using simplified likelihood;  
     full: calculates CLs and upper limits using full likelihood but quite slow.   
     -exp: calculate expected limits;  
     -mbcls: calculate CLs;  
     -uplim: calcuate upper limits.  
     The results are stored in the multibin_limits folder. Example:
     
     ./bin/CheckMATE -a atlas_2010_14293 -n "test_run" -xs "10*FB" -mb detailed -mod full -ev /path/to/events.hepmc
     
  b) Neural nets implemented with ONNX Runtime, available in atlas_2106_09609 and atlas_2211_08028:
     During configure use "--with-onnx=/path/to/onnxruntime"; see: https://onnxruntime.ai/; tested with versions 1.12.1 and 1.13.1 (linux-x64)
  c) Boosted decision trees in atlas_2010_14293 with ROOT TMVA.
